# Java-Threading-for-Multi-Client-TCP-Server
Multi-Client TCP Servers using threading in Java

Server:
If the sever is idle (no client connected to the server), an information message should be displayed “Waiting for clients on port {port_num}” Note: port_num is the port number on which your server is running
When a client tries to connect to the server, an information message should be displayed “Got connection from {client_IP}:{client_port}” Note: client_IP is the IP Address of your client and client_port is the port number on which your client is running
Show the number of active clients after every client connection, an information message should be displayed “Active Connections = {active_count}” Note: active_count is the number of active clients
Read the information sent from the client a. Display an information message “Welcome to the server {server_IP}:{server_port}” Note: server_IP is the IP Address of your server and server_port is the port number on which your server is running b. If the client wants to save the data to the server i. If the file with the client IP exists on the server (i.e. 10.10.0.187.txt) a) Append the information in the file ii. If the file with client IP does not exists on the server a) Create a file with IP address (i.e. 10.10.0.187.txt) b) Save the information to the file iii. Display information message “Information saved for client {client_IP}” Note: client_IP is the IP Address of your client c. If the client wants to read the data from the server i. Check if the file for client exists on the sever a) Display information message “Information for client {client_IP}” Note: client_IP is the IP Address of your client b) Display information from the file ii. If no file for the client exists on server a) Display information message “No Information found for client {client_IP}” Note: client_IP is the IP Address of your client


Client:
Display information message when client becomes active “Client {client_IP} is active.” Note: client_IP is the IP Address of your client2. Check if the Client wants to Get information from the sever of upload some data to the sever a. If client wants to upload data to server i. Read data from input stream and upload to server b. If the client wants to get data from server i. Read the data from the server ii. Write the data to the file on client side Note: File name should be {ClientIP}_{ServerIP}.txt (I.e. 192.168.0.1_10.10.0.187.txt)
